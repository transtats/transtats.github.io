title: Translation volume estimation

---
Having an estimate at an early stage of the development cycle is very helpful for managing localization effort. Transtats does it for releases across packages. It has three views: combined, detailed and per language. This is achieved through branch mapping maintained for every package. It is helpful for language and package maintainers to track messages during translation and packaging.
