title: Translation volume estimation

---
Having an estimate at an early stage of release cycle is very helpful for the translation team. Transtats does it for releases across packages. It has three views: combined, detailed and per language. This is achieved through branch mapping maintained for every package. It is also helpful for package maintainers and developers tracking strings while translation and packaging.
