        <h4>16. Miscellaneous Terms</h4>

        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York,
            exclusive of its choice of law rules. You and Red Hat agree to submit
            to the jurisdiction of the state courts located within Wake County,

        <p>
            Red Hat’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of any of

            If any provision contained in the Terms is held to be invalid or
            unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
            will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Red Hat
            relating to the subject matter herein and supersede all prior
